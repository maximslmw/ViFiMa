# ViFiMa
ViFiMa is a virtual (fake) file manager that runs via the terminal, akin to how file managing via a Linux Terminal works.

## Why
I'll have to use C for multiple courses in my next semester of university, therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to learn C by applying it in a project. I chose this project in particular because it can scale arbitrarily in complexity, starting with basic instructions for making and changing directories, all the way to pipelining inputs and much more.
